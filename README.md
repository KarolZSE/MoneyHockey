# Coin Hockey!
Welcome, mighty king, to my project for Week 5 of siege!
I'm excited to introduce for you Coin Hockey! It's a lot like a game you probably
played in real life, called air hockey! The rules are simple:

# What's in this game?
In this game you have:
- "Smart" enemy to play with.
- A coin to throw around.
- Win or Lose scenarion.
- Sound effects!

# How to win:
- Throw the coin in to the enemy's base.
- You win by bankrupting your enemy.

# Rules:
- You can only move on your half of the board.
- You move the coin by hitting it with your stick (? I don't know what it's called) a.k.a your mouse.
- You can adjust the coin's speed by using your mouse (You swing faster the coin moves faster, you swing slower the coin moves slower.)
- Your base is green, and the enemy's base is red.
